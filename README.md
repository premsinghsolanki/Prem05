### Hi there, I'm Prem! 👋

I am a Computer Science student at **Anand College**, currently on a mission to restart my engineering journey and master the fundamentals.

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Building logic using **C Programming**.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** Engineering Mathematics (Calculus) & Computer Fundamentals.
- 🎯 **My Goal:** To understand technology from **'Origin to Top'** rather than just using it.
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I believe logic is greater than syntax.
